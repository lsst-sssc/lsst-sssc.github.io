						<H2> SSSC Code of Conduct</H2> 
					</header>
					
				<p> The Vera C. Rubin LSST (Legacy Survey of Space and Time) Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC) is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences.
				We value the participation and contributions of every member of the SSSC, and we have a shared responsibility in maintaining the SSSC as a positive, inclusive, supportive, and successful community. 
				Accordingly, all SSSC members are expected to abide by the following Code of Conduct. 
				</p>
			
				<p> As members of the SSSC,</p>
				<ul>
					<li> We pledge to treat all people with equity and respect, providing a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, 
						disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. We will not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds 
						of bias— whether these behaviors are overt or subtle. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes and statements are not appropriate. 
					</li> 
					<br>
					<li> We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged. </li>
					<br>
					<li> We acknowledge that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will serve to enrich our collaboration. In particular, discussions and debates will be conducted in a respectful manner, taking proactive 
						measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can express their opinions in accordance with the <a href="https://lsst-sssc.github.io/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. </li>
					<br>
					<li> We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully. We will criticize ideas, not people; striving to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement. </li>
					<br>
					<li> We pledge to treat our colleagues outside of the SSSC with the same respect as within the SSSC. </li>
					<br>
					<li> We pledge to help the entire SSSC follow the Code of Conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our collaboration violate this code, such as talking privately 
						with the person and/or notifying the SSSC co-chairs, SSSC working group leads, and or the LSST Discovery Alliance Science Collaboration Coordinator. </li>
					</ul>
					

					<h3> What is Covered by the Code of Conduct </h3>

					<p>This Code of Conduct covers social misconduct, scientific/ethical misconduct, and violations of the <a href="https://lsst-sssc.github.io/publication_policy.html">SSSC Publication Policy</a>. This Code of Conduct applies to all SSSC situations and 
						interactions online and offline, in-person meetings, emails, mailing lists, forums, social media, social events associated with an SSSC or Rubin Observatory workshop or conference,
						group interactions, and one-on-one interactions. The SSSC will not tolerate harassment, bullying, or persistent unwelcome behavior of one individual or group against another. The 
						collaboration has a strong interest in nurturing the careers of junior scientists and protecting their stature and scientific freedom within the SSSC. The Appendix quotes the definition 
						of harassment adopted by the International Astronomical Union, which also applies within the SSSC. The SSSC also endorses the principles of professional conduct articulated in the 
						<a href="https://aas.org/policies/ethics#statement">American Astronomical Society’s Code of Ethics </a> and the <a href="https://www.aps.org/about/governance/policies-procedures/ethics-standards">American Physical Society’s Ethics Standards</a>. These two documents
						express the minimal standards of ethical behavior relating to the profession which all SSSC members are expected to follow by agreeing to this Code of Conduct. </p>
